    <p>This package contains an implementation of the draft XQuery API specification
    known as XQJ or JSR 225. Note that this is a draft specification and is subject to change.</p>
    
    <p>The interfaces have been renamed into a Saxon package namespace to avoid any conflicts with
    other implementations or with the official version of the interfaces when they are finally
    released.</p>
