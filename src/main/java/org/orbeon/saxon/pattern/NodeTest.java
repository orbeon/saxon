/**
  * A NodeTest is a simple kind of pattern that enables a context-free test of whether
  * a node has a particular
  * name. There are several kinds of node test: a full name test, a prefix test, and an
  * "any node of a given type" test, an "any node of any type" test, a "no nodes"
  * test (used, e.g. for "@comment()").
  *
  * <p>As well as being used to support XSLT pattern matching, NodeTests act as predicates in
  * axis steps, and also act as item types for type matching.</p>
  *
  * <p>For use in user-written application calling {@link NodeInfo#iterateAxis(byte, NodeTest)},
 * it is possible to write a user-defined subclass of <code>NodeTest</code> that implements
 * a single method, {@link #matches(int, int, int)}</p>
