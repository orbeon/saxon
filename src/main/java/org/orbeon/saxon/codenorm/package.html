    <p>This package contains the code to implement Unicode normalization.</p>
    
    <p>Much of the code is derived directly from the reference implementation
    published by the Unicode Consortium. However, the code for constructing the data
    tables used as input to the algorithm has been redesigned and rewritten for efficiency.</p>
