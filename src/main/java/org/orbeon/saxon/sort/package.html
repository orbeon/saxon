<title>Package overview for org.orbeon.saxon.sort</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides utility routines for sorting and grouping.
Specifically, it contains a QuickSort implementation,
and some AtomicComparer objects that handle character and numeric comparisons, together
with the important DocumentOrderIterator which iterates over a set of nodes in document
order.</p>

<p>The package also
contains the classes to support the implementation of the XSLT 2.0 instruction
 xsl:for-each-group, and some utilities for maintaining sets and maps whose keys
 are unboxed integer values.</p>
