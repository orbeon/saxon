<p>
This package provides glue classes that enable Saxon to process a source document supplied
 as a XOM tree (see <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM">http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM</a>).</p>
<p>
These classes are not part of the core <code>saxon8.jar</code> product, but are released as a separate
 <code>saxon8-xom.jar</code>.</p>
<p>
The package provides implementations of the Saxon DocumentInfo and NodeInfo interfaces that act as wrappers to
 the relevant XOM classes.</p>

<p>Much of the implemention of this package was done by Wolfgang Hoschek, based on Michael Kay's similar
package for JDOM.</p>
