<title>Package overview for org.orbeon.saxon.sql</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides some sample extension elements for loading data into an SQL database.</p>

<p>These classes are not intended as a production-quality tool, rather as an illustration
 of what can be achieved using extension elements. The classes are not distributed in the main
 <code>saxon8.jar</code> file, but in a separate <code>saxon8-sql.jar</code> file, which must
 be added to the classpath when these extensions are used.</p>
 
 <p>These SQL extensions are documented in the file <code>sql-extension.html</code> in the main
 documentation directory.</p>
