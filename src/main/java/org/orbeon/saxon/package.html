<p>This package provides the core classes of the SAXON XSLT library. </p>

<p>Some of the more important classes are listed below: </p>

<p><b>Transform</b>:<br>
This is the XSLT processor. It has a command-line interface allowing you to
apply a given style sheet to a given source document.</p>

<p><b>PreparedStylesheet</b>:<br>
This represents a compiled XSLT stylesheet in memory. It is Saxon's implementation of the
<tt>javax.xml.transform.Templates</tt> interface defined in JAXP 1.1</p>

<p><b>Controller</b>:<br>
This class represents the context information for a single execution of an XSLT stylesheet,
and allows the application to process the tree navigationally. It is Saxon's implementation
of the javax.xml.transform.Transformer interface defined in JAXP 1.1. It calls
user-supplied handlers registered with the RuleManager.
If you want to write your own Java application to process a document navigationally, you
can write it as a subclass of Controller, or you can instantiate Controller
directly. </p>
