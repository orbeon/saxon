  <body>
    <p>This package contains the code to implement Ant tasks that invoke Saxon.</p>
    
    <p>At present there is one such task, to invoke a Saxon transformation. This is based very
    closely on the <code>xslt</code> task provided as a core task in the Ant product, but
    extended to allow access to XSLT 2.0 and Saxon-specific features.</p>
