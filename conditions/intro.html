      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The Initial Developer of the Original Code is Michael Kay. Until February 2001 Michael Kay
         was an employee of International Computers Limited (now part of Fujitsu Limited), and original code
         developed during that time was released under this license by permission from International Computers Limited.
         From February 2001 until February 2004 Michael Kay was an employee of Software AG, and code developed 
         during that time was released under this license by permission from Software AG, acting as a "Contributor".
         Subsequent code has been developed by Saxonica Limited, of which Michael Kay is a Director, again acting
         as a "Contributor". A small number of modules, or enhancements to modules, have been developed by other individuals
         (either written specially for Saxon, or incorporated into Saxon having initially been released as part of another
         open source product). Such contributions are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code
         modules.  All Rights Reserved.

         Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge for details of known errors; all bugs are
         listed there as soon as I have sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.
